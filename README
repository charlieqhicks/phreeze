Phreeze 3.0 
===========

Phreeze is an ORM and MVC Framework for PHP with an included code generator that creates a clean, functional site based on a database schema.

Apps generated with the Phreeze builder provide a RESTful API on the server side.  The client utilizes backbone.js for model and collection binding and bootstrap for a clean layout and user interface.

The user interfaces generated by Phreeze make an excellent starting point for an application and save a good deal of redundant "plumbing" code.  Phreeze recognizes different data-types and foreign key relationships to create basic viewers and editors that can be used as-is or customized further. 

Code examples and training videos are available at http://phreeze.com/
